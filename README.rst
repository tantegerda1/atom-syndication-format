Purpose
=======

Provides classes that model the entities in RFC 4287 Atom feeds. Can be used to easily create Atom feeds.



Warning
=======

This is alpha-state software. Its class and method signatures will change. As soon as things have settled enough, a proper major version will be released. (Also, PHPDoc is not brushed enough.)



Thanks
======

AtomEnabled: I mostly copied their documentation.
